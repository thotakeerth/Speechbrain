## Installing Extra Dependencies

Before proceeding, ensure you have installed the necessary additional dependencies. To do this, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install -r extra_requirements.txt
```

For `k2`-based recipes, you will first need to install `k2`. The integration has been tested with `k2==1.24.4` and `torch==2.0.1`, although it should also work with any `torch` version as long as `k2` supports it (compatibility list [here](https://k2-fsa.github.io/k2/installation/pre-compiled-cuda-wheels-linux/index.html)). You can install `k2` by following the instructions [here](https://k2-fsa.github.io/k2/installation/from_wheels.html#linux-cuda-example).


# WFST-based CTC training/inference
To fine-tune a wav2vec 2.0 model with the WFST-based CTC loss, you can use the `train_with_wav2vec_k2.py` script. This will create a `lang` directory inside your output folder, which will contain the files required to build a lexicon FST. The tokenization method used here is a very basic character-based tokenization (e.g. `hello -> h e l l o`).

Using a lexicon FST (L) while training can help guide the model to better predictions. When decoding, you can either use a simple HL decoding graph (where H is the ctc topology), or use an HLG graph (where G is usually a 3-gram language model) to further improve the results. In addition, whole lattice rescoring is also supported. This typically happens with a 4-gram language model. See `hparams/train_with_wav2vec_k2.yaml`` for more details.

If you choose to use a 3-gram or a 4-gram language model, you can either supply pre-existing ARPA LMs for both cases, including the option to train your own, or you can specify the name in the YAML docstring for automatic downloading. Comprehensive instructions are provided in `train_hf_wav2vec_k2.yaml`.

For those interested in training their own language model, please consult our recipe at ESTER+EPAC+ETAPE+REPERE/LM/train_ngram.py.

Example usage:
```
 python3 train_with_wav2vec_ctc_k2.py hparams/train_with_wav2vec_ctc_k2_phone.yaml --data_folder=/path/to/ESTER+EPAC+ETAPE+REPERE/parent_dir
```

To use the HLG graph (instead of the default HL), pass `--compose_HL_with_G=True`. To use the 4-gram LM for rescoring, pass the `--decoding_method=whole-lattice-rescoring` argument. Note that this will require more memory, as the whole lattice will be kept in memory during the decoding. In this recipe, the `lm_scale` used by default is 0.4.
