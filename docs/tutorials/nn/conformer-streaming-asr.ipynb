    "_Yes,_ we _could_, and it does help somewhat, but consider the implications when stacking layers! For instance, consider two layers of attention, where $a$ is the input, $b$ is the output of the first layer, and $c$ is the output of the second layer: $c_t$ will attend to $b_{t+1}$ (among others), which itself will attend to $a_{t+2}$. This gets worse in practice, when we might have something like 12 or 17 layers.  \n",

We _can_ afford to introduce the idea of some right context for this, as it represents speech in the order of milliseconds anyway. This kind of simplifies the whole ordeal, and gives more flexibility for poking around the feature extractor.\n",

    "SpeechBrain provides a wrapper, [`speechbrain.lobes.features.StreamingFeatureWrapper`](https://speechbrain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/API/speechbrain.lobes.features.html#speechbrain.lobes.features.StreamingFeatureWrapper), which abstracts this for you almost entirely, by automatically padding and caching context. It still needs to be told the characteristics of the feature extractor, which we will expand on later on.\n",

    "Absolute positional embeddings would be a big problem for streaming: They basically encode the position of each token relative to the start of the sentence.

    "\n",
    "Left context size is purely a tradeoff between accuracy and computational/memory cost. Here too, it is worth evaluating the model with different sizes depending on the desired tradeoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to pick the chunk size?\n",
    "\n",
    "Curiously, it doesn't have to be static! The following strategy works surprisingly well:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For 40% of the batches (at random), we train normally without any chunking strategy.\n",
    "- For the other 60%, we do the following:\n",

    "### Wrapping the feature extractor for inference\n",
    "\n",
    "We briefly touched on wrapping the feature extractor for streaming inference. The Conformer feature extractor we use here has essentially three layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Filterbank extraction, derived directly from a fourier transform of the signal\n",
    "2. Normalization (which we choose to apply per-chunk at streaming, as described earlier -- it doesn't really affect things)\n",
    "3. Downsampling CNN, which is a convolution with a stride of 2, effectively reducing the dimension along the time axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a whole, ... (TODO: show example dependency matrix?)\n",
    "\n",
    "We have two problems here:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Since the feature extractor radically affects the time dimension of the input waveform, we need to understand how to map from a number of frames at encoder level (after feature extraction) to a number of input frames (before feature extraction). TODO: because we need to split the input stream, etc. etc.\n",
    "- We need to handle left/past and right/future context correctly for the feature extractor to behave basically exactly the same as it did during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach taken to greatly streamline this process, with less manual calculations, is the [`StreamingFeatureWrapper`](https://speechbrain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/API/speechbrain.lobes.features.html#speechbrain.lobes.features.StreamingFeatureWrapper) and associated tooling over at [`speechbrain.utils.filter_analysis`](https://speechbrain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/API/speechbrain.utils.filter_analysis.html#module-speechbrain.utils.filter_analysis).\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, we consider filterbank extraction and the CNN as filters (in the signal processing sense) with specific stride, kernel size, dilation and causality settings. In this case, we only need to care about stride and kernel size.\n",
